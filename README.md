# Brick Breaker 🧱
Brick Breaker is a game in which a player smashes a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. A Player can control the game either by mouser or keyboard keys. The player gets 5 lives at the starting and a life is lost if the ball hits the bottom of the screen. 
We have made this project for the hackathon organized by Devsnest.
